-version04: nextjs / react / redux / sass @media

========================== MISSION
-to practice Redux / SASS
	-using next.js / react / etc
-simple increment side with three routes in total

========================== LEFT OFF
-redux
	-just install redux from redux example because combineReducers() does not work with next.js at all.
		- the redux example works fine & now I can add multiple reducers
		-I would like to write some notes on nextjs word doc about this in best practice because nextjs goes through node first which is causing problem to this
		-I would also need to install redux devtool as module just like the example
	-note on nextjs word doc about window object does not work because nextjs goes through node first before browser
		-list ways to use window object
	-after you have finish you can then continue using redux for your increment logic
	-started using chrome browser instead
========================== DONE
-deploy on Netlify straight away to see how it affects your side everytime you merge to master branch

-create three pages
	-increment page (/)
	-side page	(/side)
	-error page	(/*)

-create layout to include header & footer

-style using SASS
	-install SASS
	-implement SASS
		-both / & /side & /404

-create the three links in our header component

========================== TODO
-Redux
	-setup up redux directory
		-including redux devtool
	-two action types
		-increment action
		-decrement action


========================== NOTES
rm -fr node_modules/ package-lock.json .next/ && npm cache clean -vf && npm i && npm run dev
	-will remove dir/files > clean npm cache > reinstall > run dev
	-place on notes

========================== PLAYGROUND
